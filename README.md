# SRB2-ManhuntMod
recreating minecraft manhunt to a certain extent
Type "mhhelp" into the SRB2 console to get a brief explanation of commands.
Players are given the freedom to choose who's a speedrunner and who's the hunter.
the "rdy" is unfortunately case-sensitive. Each stage has a countdown timer of about 4 seconds of leeway.
code may be messy since it was made years ago
