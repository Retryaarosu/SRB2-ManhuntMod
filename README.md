# SRB2-ManhuntMod
Recreating Minecraft manhunt to a certain extent in SRB2. With some give and take due to trying to flow just a bit better.

# Commands
Type "mhhelp" into the SRB2 console to get a brief explanation of commands.

# Important notes
Players are given the freedom to choose who's a speedrunner and who's the hunter.
the "rdy" is unfortunately case-sensitive. Each stage has a countdown timer of about 4 seconds of leeway.
code may be messy since it was made years ago
